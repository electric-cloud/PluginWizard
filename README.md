### Getting Started
1. Download or clone the PluginWizard repository.

    ```
	git clone https://github.com/electric-cloud/PluginWizard.git
    ```

1. Copy to a new directory, say 'MyPlugin'.

    ```
	cp -r PluginWizard MyPlugin
    ```
    
1. Remove Git files from 'MyPlugin'.

    ```
	rm -rf MyPlugin/.git*
    ```
    
1. Assign a version number to your plugin, e.g., 1.0.0. Edit
    META-INF/plugin.xml (key, version, label) with the name and version
    of your plugin.    

1. Setup the directory structure for your procedures as described [here][1].

1. Finally, zip up the files to create the plugin zip file.

    ```
	 cd MyPlugin
	 zip -r MyPlugin.zip ./*
    ```

1. Import the plugin zip file into your ElectricFlow server and promote it.  
     
Your plugin procedure is now available for use!
